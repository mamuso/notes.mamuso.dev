However, many renderers – like Github's and Markdown Here – support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers);\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\n\nInline code has back-ticks around it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks – they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.\n\n \n\n```javascript\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n \n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n \n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. \nBut let's throw in a tag.\n```\n\n\n\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n\n\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n\n\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.\nBut let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.\n\n\nMath expressions\n\n\n\nYou can write math expressions using the Latex markup language between dollar signs.\n\nThey can be written inline (single-dollar signs $...$) or as a whole block (double dollar signs with a line above and under $$...$$).\n\nFor example,\n\nBayes Theorem is $P(A \\vert B) = \\frac{P(B \\vert A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$\n\n\nwill render as :\n\nBayes Theorem is : $P(A \\vert B) = \\frac{P(B \\vert A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$\n\nWhereas\n\nBayes Theorem is :\n\n$$P(A \\vert B) = \\frac{P(B \\vert A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n\n\n\nwill render as :\n\nBayes Theorem is :\n\n$$\nP(A \\vert B) = \\frac{P(B \\vert A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n$$\n\nPlease note that for a math block to be displayed correctly, it needs to be separated by an empty line, above and below. Besides, the pipe character | may conflict with Markdown : it is recommended to use \\vert instead.\n\nTables\n\n\n\nTables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email – a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.\n\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the\nraw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\n\nMarkdown | Less | Pretty\n--- | --- | ---\n*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\n1 | 2 | 3\n\n\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Tables\n      Are\n      Cool\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      col 3 is\n      right-aligned\n      $1600\n    \n    \n      col 2 is\n      centered\n      $12\n    \n    \n      zebra stripes\n      are neat\n      $1\n    \n  \n\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the\nraw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Markdown\n      Less\n      Pretty\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Still\n      renders\n      nicely\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      3\n    \n  \n\n\nBlockquotes\n\n\n\n&gt; Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n&gt; This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n&gt; This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.\n\n\n\n  Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\nThis line is part of the same quote.\n\n\nQuote break.\n\n\n  This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps.

Use HTML &lt;em&gt;tags&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/dl&gt;\n\n\nYou can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.\n\n\n  Definition list\n  Is something people use sometimes.\n\n  Markdown in HTML\n  Does *not* work **very** well.

You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend.\n\nHere are some things to try out:\n\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n\n\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a separate paragraph.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but…\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the same paragraph.\n\nLicense: CC-BY"
